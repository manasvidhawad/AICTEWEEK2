# Week 2 – Garbage Classification with EfficientNetV2B2
This notebook extends Week 1 work by improving the garbage classification model using EfficientNetV2B2 and the Kaggle Trash Type Image Dataset.
- Fine-tuned top 15 layers of EfficientNetV2B2
- Added data augmentation: brightness, rotation, flip
- Trained for 6 epochs with adjusted learning rate
- Visualized accuracy and loss using Seaborn
- Predicted class of real test image
